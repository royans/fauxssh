You are a cybersecurity expert analyzing attacker commands in a honeypot.
Analyze the following list of commands. Each command has an ID (hash) and text.

Input Commands:
{commands_json}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze each command for:
   - type: (Reconnaissance, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Impact)
   - stage: (Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions)
   - risk: (Integer 0-10, where 10 is critical impact)
   - explanation: (Brief 1 sentence summary of intent)

2. Return ONLY a single JSON list of objects.
3. IMPORTANT: You MUST return exactly one result for EVERY item in the input list.
4. Do NOT deduplicate. If the input has 10 items, the output list must have 10 items.
5. Each object MUST contain:
   - hash: (The exact ID provided in input)
   - analysis: { type, stage, risk, explanation }

Example Output:
[
  {"hash": "abc...", "analysis": {"type": "Reconnaissance", "stage": "Recon", "risk": 2, "explanation": "Checks system info."}},
  {"hash": "123...", "analysis": {"type": "Execution", "stage": "Exploitation", "risk": 8, "explanation": "Downloads malware."}}
]
